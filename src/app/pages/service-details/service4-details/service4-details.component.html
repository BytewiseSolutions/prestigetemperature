                        Too Warm or Too Cold: If the temperature inside your fridge or freezer is inconsistent, it can
                        lead to food spoilage or
                        frozen items. This issue often arises from a malfunctioning thermostat, a faulty defrost timer,
                        or problems with the
                        condenser coils.

                        Frost Build-Up: Excessive frost in the freezer can indicate issues with the defrost system,
                        including the defrost
                        heater, defrost thermostat, or defrost timer.

                        Water puddling inside or around your refrigerator usually points to a blocked defrost drain or a
                        malfunctioning water
                        inlet valve. This can lead to mold growth and further damage if not addressed promptly.

                        Unusual noises such as buzzing, humming, or rattling can be signs of various issues ranging from
                        a faulty compressor,
                        condenser fan, evaporator fan, or simply a need for leveling the appliance.
